# Chat simulation between clients

This project simulates a chat between clients using a server. Follow the steps below to run the project.

## Running the Server
1. Navigate to the `client/src` directory in your terminal
2. Compile the server using the following command: ``` javac Server.java```
3. After a successful compilation, run the server using the command ``` javac Server```

### Running the client :
1. Open a new terminal at the folder `server/src`
2. Compile the client using the following command ```javac Client.java```
3. You can open multiple clients by running the command at step 2 in different terminals

Each terminal will act as a new client in the chat simulation
